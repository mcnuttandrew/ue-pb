If this is the first time running the development environment run `yarn` from the terminal to install the dependencies. If you do not have this command, see the [docs](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/) for installation instructions. If you do not have node install, you should install it.

Next you are ready to run the development environment. Do so by running `yarn start` from the terminal. This will start up a development server which you can use to navigate to the application. (It'll tell you the URL but it'll probably be http://localhost:8080). Keep this process running and builds will be triggered whenever you make a change.
